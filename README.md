  Q-zone website
  
  Users can register for accounts and then log in to the website to experience these functions:
  
	File Sharing: upload, view, and delete files associated with various users. (PHP and MySQL).
	Multi-Chat Room: Users can sign on in the main lobby with a nickname and can communicate with each other in arbitrary room. Users can send private messages to another user in the same room. User can also create private room with password protected. Creators can temporarily or permanently kick members out of the room. (The server was built in Node.JS and Socket.IO). 
	My Story: Registered users can submit, edit, delete their own stories and delete comments. Unregistered users can only view others story and comment. (PHP and MySQL).
	Users’ Calendar Memo: Registered users can add and remove events tag dynamically on their calendar. (Used JavaScript to process user interactions and utilized AJAX to run server-side scripts that query database to save and retrieve information, including user accounts and events.)
  Interactive blog based on Laravel framework in PHP.
	Registered Users can post or edit their own blog and read other’s blog and comments, also users can post anonymous blog, choose different categories tag to post.
	Used bootstrap for a visually appealing design. 
	Used Apache to serve Laravel application and MySQL as databases.
